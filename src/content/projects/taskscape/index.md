## Why I Created TaskScape

TaskScape was born out of a desire to create a simple yet powerful task management tool that doesn't overwhelm users with unnecessary features. My goal was to develop an app that could seamlessly integrate into users' daily routines, helping them manage their tasks efficiently without getting in the way. This is my first full attempt to publish an app, and I aim to learn more about the process of bringing an app to the Play Store and meeting all the necessary requirements for submission to the Apple App Store, ensuring a wide reach and accessibility for users on both major platforms.

I recognize that the app, in its current form, might be considered too simple for approval. Therefore, I plan to add more features and unique elements to enhance its functionality and appeal. This will not only increase its chances of acceptance but also provide users with a richer experience.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Tasks**: Effortlessly create new tasks and manage them with options to mark tasks as complete or incomplete. TaskScape's minimalist design ensures that you can focus on your tasks without unnecessary distractions.
