Our brain work in funny ways, when you actually get to choose between multiple things you will likely not be as happy as you could if you only had one option. Having to decide between multiple things will only make you regret not choosing the other things when you start to become unsatisfied with your choice in the first place.

I like to think that you will always regret your choices, you will always think about what could have happened if you took another way or made other choices, that will lead you nowhere though, because you did not take the other way. You will always have that feeling.

As humans we get used to things, that's why we are the most dominant especies in the world, we easily adapt to new things. This means that if you earn 1 billion dollars or if you have a terrible accident, after one year you will probably be as happy as you were before any of those things happened.

Knowing that you could have done things differently will not change anything. Keep suffering for possible routes not taken is not the smartest thing to do.

Just deal with it. Do your best with the choices you have made.
