I tend to walk away from authority and hierarchy, usually, that ends badly for me. How I understand the world is somewhat too different from what people around me do. For a long time in my life, I thought that it was authentic.

When I got into trouble because of that, people usually would tell me “Be who you are” or “This is just how you are” sort of like it was part of what I was.

Well, now I see this does not make any sense. Thinking like that it damaging you. You cannot see yourself as just a person with predefined actions or thoughts, we’re always changing, evolving.

I don’t see humans, especially myself this way. Whoever you are, you are not this immutable entity.

You just are something at this very moment.

So the next time you hear “just be yourself”, please don’t.

Adapt yourself to the circumstances in order to get what you want.
