When you’re doing something you rarely see any progress, only when you look back 2, 3 months you realize how much you have done.

On the other hand though when you make mistakes it is there, it’s clear and you feel it right away.

This is for relationships, work, or when you’re learning something. Your mistakes are always there at the very moment you make them. Your progress and how far you’ve gone aren’t there in the short term.

And it’s only when you look back or lose something that you realize all the good things that had you did.

Being aware of that helps you make much better decisions. You will make mistakes eventually, and when it happens it will hit you hard but they should not be seen as something bad, just like something that could be avoided, and hopefully, you won’t make then again.
