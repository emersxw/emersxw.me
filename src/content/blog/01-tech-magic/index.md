It’s amazing that you can get in touch with someone from the other side of the world in seconds.

You can call them, videocall them, text them, see their photos on instagram and twitter posts in seconds. Everything just works.

That’s probably a view of someone outside of the ‘programming world’.

Because in reality, nothing works, nothing is good enough, the internet is made of hacks and tricks.

A bunch of them.

There’s nothing of magic, there are only struggles to make something work.

But it does. If anyone could come up with a plan to make the internet as we know it nowadays from zero I’m sure it would fail.

Maybe that’s why it works? No one ever intended to build it like that, therefore here it is.
