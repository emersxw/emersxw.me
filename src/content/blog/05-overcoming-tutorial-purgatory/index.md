### What’s the Tutorial Purgatory?

The "Tutorial Purgatory" is a term coined by Andy Sterkowitz to describe the cycle of endlessly watching tutorials without ever applying what you've learned. It's a common trap for self-taught developers who feel they need to learn everything before they're ready to build something on their own. This cycle can lead to a false sense of progress, where you feel like you're learning but never actually create anything tangible.

I found myself stuck in this cycle, constantly buying new courses and watching tutorials without ever building anything. It wasn't until I discovered freeCodeCamp that I began to break free. By building projects and applying what I learned, I gained the confidence to tackle new challenges. The hands-on experience taught me more than any tutorial ever could, and I began to see real progress in my skills.

### Conclusion

The key to overcoming the "Tutorial Purgatory" is to start building. Apply what you've learned, experiment, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. By doing so, you'll gain the practical experience and confidence needed to succeed as a developer. Remember, learning is an active process, and the best way to learn is by doing. So take the leap, build something amazing, and watch your skills grow.
