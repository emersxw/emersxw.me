While in university, I co-founded a software development company that
tackled some really interesting projects with over 10 clients. Here are a few
that stand out:

- **Novo Nordisk:** We created software to streamline lab equipment
  management, tracking usage and user details, optimizing workflow and
  ensuring equipment availability.

- **Gerando Falcões:** We developed the "Gerando Educação" app, providing
  education to over 12,000 underprivileged youth, offering classes, workshops,
  and career training.

**tech stack:**  Typescript/Javascript, React, Node, Nextjs, Express, PostgreSQL,
GraphQL, Styled Components, MongoDB.
